# Platform_manage_laundryshops
'Laundry shops are a vital service for the residents of Ho Chi Minh City, especially in urban areas with busy lifestyles. However, many shop owners face challenges in managing their businesses, including tracking orders, handling customer data, and monitoring revenue. Currently, there is no centralized platform tailored for these shop owners to efficiently manage their operations and customer interactions. This project seeks to address these challenges by building a platform that streamlines shop management and enhances operational efficiency. 

Proposed Solutions  
The solution is a multi-tenant web-based platform where laundry shop owners can register their shops and use tools to manage daily operations. The platform will allow shop owners to track orders, assign tasks, manage customer data, and monitor financial performance. Customers can find registered shops, place orders, and track their laundry status. By providing a centralized and user-friendly system, the platform will improve service delivery, save time, and empower laundry businesses to scale effectively.

Provide platform-wide notifications (e.g., maintenance updates, feature announcements).
